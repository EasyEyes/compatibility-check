- peerjs 2 way communication
    tester (experiment computer) and tested (phone)

- github pages endpoint will define both, and instantiate the testpad. 
    this hosted endpoint will run on the phone,
    and export a class to be run on the experiment


Tester (computer) class
    - peerjs peer that will 
        - initiate commmunication (ie generate a url to be embedded as qr code)
        - block until `results` message


Tested (phone) class
    - will open on page load
    - will expect peerID in url params
    - will run code that is hardcoded in the class (ie some js queries that the sound-calibration team will provide)
    - will wait until said code is done
    - will send back the results to that code (ie to computer)
    - will close page

Index.html
    - will export the tester class
    - will embody the tested class
    - analagous to keypad.html in virtual-keypad
